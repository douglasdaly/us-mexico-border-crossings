### Requirements

In order to run this code you'll need the data from the [Mexican Migration Project](https://mmp.opr.princeton.edu/) (which cannot be provided in this repository).  You'll need to independently obtain the following zip files from the MMP to run the code in this repository:

 - cnmig161.csv.zip
 - house161.csv.zip
 - life161.csv.zip
 - mig161.csv.zip
 - migother161.csv.zip
 - pers161.csv.zip
 - spouse161.csv.zip

Once you've acquired these files you'll need to copy them into the `data/raw/` directory.  You can verify the files you copied by checking them against the sha-1 hashes in the `mmp_files.sha1` file.
